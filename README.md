# what-to-eat

## Description

Allows users to enter a list of groceries they have into a Mongo database, edit and sort the data, sort it, check it through themealdb's database of recipes that can be made from those groceries, then returns a random meal that can be made with the ingredients (or at least a starting point ingredient).
